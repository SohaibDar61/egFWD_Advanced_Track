# EDF Scheduler Using FreeRTOS
Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is a shecduling algorithm that adopts a dynamic priority-based preemptive scheduling policy, 
meaning that the priority of a task can change during its execution, and the processing of any task is interrupted 
by a request for any higher priority task.
